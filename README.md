- 👋 Hi, I’m Santiago
- 👀 I’m interested in .net and Svelte technologies.
- 🌱 I’m currently developing some sort of [gardening](https://github.com/sstriatlon/gardenist) application with [konvaJS](https://github.com/konvajs/konva) and React!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to open source, ecology or astronomy.
- 📫 You can reach me on santiago.dev@outlook.com
